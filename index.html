                        <p>My name is Morgan Fuqua and I am seeking full-time employment in the Greater Birmingham Area. I completed a Full Stack Development bootcamp in early 2021 and have most recently spent my time working as a software developer at Buffalo Rock. 
                         <br>   
                            <br>
                        TrueCoders was a great starting point for getting into the IT field. Their "mental model" of always being open to learning more has helped boost my confidene into being willing to take on new, sometimes foreign, tasks in order to acquire knowledge in an attempt to atleast fail forward. This is a quality I've been able to bring with me in both jobs since then.
                            <br>
                                <br>
                        At Fintech Advantage I learned the role and responsibility of a Business Analyst/Project Manager. Sourcing, tracking and maintaining the data of a growing business is an integral part of knowing where they're at and how they should improve. I found and learned JIRA in order to set up project/task management that complied with company standards, used the dashboards in our daily meetings to gain insights from employees on updates or delays, and would extract data at the end of the week to create status reports used in high level meetings. I was also able to create a company website after learning WordPress with Creatopy. That process included wireframes, logo creation, color schemes, proper wording of company values and services to best describe the business' goal, writing job descriptions for vacancies, and importing forms and tracking submissions through an external software.
                            <br>
                                <br>
                        After that, I transitioned to a back-end Software Developer at Buffalo Rock. I have used my willingness to learn as a main asset in this role. My knowledge of C# best practices transitioned well into a working knowledge of Python, which I've used to access databases and forms, create custom Anvil applications, transfer data using API connections, and write scripts on RaspberryPi kiosks. I also took on the responsiblity of learning and then maintaining multiple PowerBi dashboards that tracked data coming off the bottling lines in one of our warehouses. That undertaking turned into an additional project of creating a dashboard that contained strictly the high level data points such as bottles filled, line speed, and multiple loss percentages in order to maintain a full picture of the daily process.
